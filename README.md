# SF Tabs 

A browser extension that lets Salesforce administrators customize their setup menu by adding, editing, and managing quick-access tabs.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please check out the [issues page](https://github.com/chrisrouse/sftabs/issues). I'm specifically looking for help with translations right now. If there are other features you are interested in, please open a feature request issue first and explain request.

## License and Usage

SF Tabs is open source. If you want to make your own copy of it, you can, but I'd really prefer it if you contributed to this project instead. It is offered as-is, but I've done my best to make sure there are no bugs. I don't collect any information from your usage beyond what Firefox and Chrome provide about extension installations. All of your data is stored on your computer or within your browser user profile.
