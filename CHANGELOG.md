# Changelog

## [1.0.1] - April 19, 2025

### Enhancements
- Hover color for tabs now follows the branding of the current theme in you org.

### Bug fixes
- Improved handling of tabs across multiple tabs or windows so that they no longer randomly disappear. 
- There was an issue where switching between Object Manager, a custom tab, and back again would also cause all of the tabs to change to the active styling.

### Notes
- Setting the custom active tab is tricky due to how Salesforce handles the tabs. For now, only hover color works.
