# Changelog

## [1.2.0] - May 4, 2025
- Updated selectors for light and dark mode. It should automatically use your previous setting, but you may have to reselect the correct mode.
- Added Compact Mode for more efficient tab display. Makes it easier to see more tabs in the popup.
- Enhanced tab type detection with visual indicators (Setup, Object, Custom). Linking to an Object Manager page, Flow Trigger Explorer, or even Flow Builder, all work properly within Setup. You can also link to an Object page for faster access to your most-used objects.
- Better support for Object Manager paths and custom URLs.
- Improved tab creation from current page with intelligent label detection.
- Removed panel height selector since the range was limited by browser defaults. Made the panel taller and wider by default. Panel automatically expands to the max height based on browser limits.
- Fixed header and improved scrolling in popup
- Improved active tab handling. Removed the active style from the Setup and Object Manager tabs. This occasionally doesn't work due to issues with how long some Setup pages take to load.

### Feature Requests
- Thanks to [Natalie Gunther](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nataliegunther/), [Joel Slack](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joel-slack/), and [Mark Jones](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thisismarkjones/) for being early users of SF Tabs and requesting new features!

### Known Limitation
- Due to the way popup focus is handled in plugins in Firefox for Mac, accessing the emoji keyboard causes the popup window to close. If you'd like to use an emoji in your tab name, you'll need to copy/paste it into the label.

## [1.1.0] - April 19, 2025

### Enhancements
- Hover color for tabs now follows the branding of the current theme in you org.

### Bug fixes
- Improved handling of tabs across multiple tabs or windows so that they no longer randomly disappear. 
- There was an issue where switching between Object Manager, a custom tab, and back again would also cause all of the tabs to change to the active styling.

### Notes
- Setting the custom active tab is tricky due to how Salesforce handles the tabs. For now, only hover color works.
