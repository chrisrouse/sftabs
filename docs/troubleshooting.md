# Troubleshooting

## Tabs not appearing in Salesforce

- Make sure you're on a Salesforce Setup page (URL should contain `/lightning/setup/`)
- Try refreshing the page
- Check that the extension is enabled in your browser

## Tab links not working

- Verify the path is correct for your org
- Make sure you have permission to access that Setup page
- Try using a different path format (Setup page name vs. Lightning URL)

## Settings not saving

- Check that the extension has storage permissions
- Try disabling and re-enabling the extension
- Clear browser cache and restart
