## Best Practices

### Choosing Key Combinations

- **Use modifier keys:** Always include Ctrl/Cmd and/or Shift to avoid conflicts with existing shortcuts
- **Be consistent:** Use a pattern like `Ctrl+Shift+[Number]` for all your tabs
- **Avoid conflicts:** Check that your chosen shortcuts don't conflict with browser or Salesforce shortcuts
- **Consider frequency:** Assign shortcuts to your most frequently used tabs first

### Common Key Combination Conflicts to Avoid

| Shortcut | Existing Function | Browser |
|:---------|:------------------|:--------|
| `Ctrl+1` through `Ctrl+9` | Switch to browser tab 1-9 | Both |
| `Ctrl+T` | New tab | Both |
| `Ctrl+W` | Close tab | Both |
| `Ctrl+N` | New window | Both |


## Organizing Your Tabs for Shortcuts

Since shortcuts correspond to tab positions, organize your tabs strategically:

1. **Identify your most-used pages**
   Determine which Setup pages you visit most frequently

2. **Reorder tabs in the extension**
   Drag and drop your most important tabs to positions 1-10

3. **Assign shortcuts**
   Configure keyboard shortcuts for these priority tabs

4. **Test and adjust**
   Use your shortcuts for a few days and reorder as needed

### Example Organization

Here's an example of how you might organize tabs for optimal shortcut usage:

| Position | Tab Name | Shortcut | Why |
|:---------|:---------|:---------|:----|
| 1 | Flows | `Ctrl+Shift+1` | Most frequently accessed |
| 2 | Users | `Ctrl+Shift+2` | Second most common |
| 3 | Profiles | `Ctrl+Shift+3` | Regular maintenance |
| 4 | Permission Sets | `Ctrl+Shift+4` | Security configuration |
| 5 | Custom Metadata | `Ctrl+Shift+5` | Development work |


## Troubleshooting

### Shortcut doesn't work

- Make sure you're on a Salesforce page when pressing the shortcut
- Verify the shortcut is configured correctly in browser settings
- Check that you have a tab at that position (e.g., Tab 5 won't work if you only have 4 tabs)
- Ensure the shortcut doesn't conflict with another extension or browser function

### Can't set a shortcut

- The key combination may be reserved by the browser
- Try a different combination with more modifier keys (e.g., `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+1`)
- Some keys may be restricted by your operating system

### Shortcut opens wrong tab

- Remember that shortcuts correspond to tab positions (0-9), not tab IDs
- If you reorder tabs, the shortcuts will open different pages
- Check the extension popup to see which tab is in which position


## Tips & Tricks

### Power User Workflow

1. Create tabs for your 5-10 most common Setup pages
2. Order them by frequency of use
3. Assign shortcuts to the top 5 tabs
4. Use shortcuts for quick navigation, popup for less frequent tabs

### Team Standardization

If your team shares a configuration file, document recommended shortcuts so everyone uses the same key combinations. This makes it easier to help each other and share tips.

### Muscle Memory

It takes about 2-3 weeks of regular use to build muscle memory for keyboard shortcuts. Be patient and keep using them!
