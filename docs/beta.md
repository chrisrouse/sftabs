# Install Beta Version

Want to try out the latest features before they're released? Install the beta version to test new functionality and help us improve SF Tabs!

## Chrome Beta Testing

The SF Tabs beta version is available on the Chrome Web Store for early testing.

### Installing the Beta

1. **Visit the Chrome Web Store**
   [Install SF Tabs BETA](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sf-tabs-beta/YOUR_BETA_EXTENSION_ID)

2. **Click "Add to Chrome"**
   The beta version can be installed alongside the stable version

3. **Grant Permissions**
   Accept the required permissions for Salesforce domains

### Beta Features

The current beta includes:

- **New floating button** - Quick access to your tabs from anywhere in Salesforce
- **Improved navigation** - Enhanced Lightning navigation support
- **Better performance** - Optimized storage and tab rendering
- **Chrome Manifest V3** - Full compatibility with Chrome's latest requirements

### Important Notes

⚠️ **This is beta software**
- You may encounter bugs or unexpected behavior
- Features may change based on feedback
- Report issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/chrisrouse/sftabs/issues)

🔄 **Running Both Versions**
- Beta and stable versions can run simultaneously
- Each has separate storage (won't share settings)
- Different icons help distinguish between versions

💾 **Data Safety**
- Always export your configuration before testing
- Use local storage mode if you're concerned about syncing
- Beta data won't affect your stable version

### Version Numbering

Beta versions use a four-part version number:
- `2.0.0.1` = Beta 1
- `2.0.0.2` = Beta 2
- `2.0.1` = Stable release
