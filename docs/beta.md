# Install Beta Version

Want to try out the latest features before they're released? Install the beta version to test new functionality and help us improve SF Tabs!

## Chrome Beta Testing

The SF Tabs beta version is available on the Chrome Web Store for early testing.

### Installing the Beta

1. **Visit the Chrome Web Store**
   [Install SF Tabs BETA](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/sf-tabs-beta/enmddneajopnbjcalpeapgjoideekdhn?utm_source=item-share-cb)

2. **Click "Add to Chrome"**
   The beta version can be installed alongside the stable version

3. **Grant Permissions**
   Accept the required permissions for Salesforce domains

### Beta Features

The current beta includes:

- **New floating button** - Quick access to your tabs from anywhere in Salesforce
- **Improved navigation** - Enhanced Lightning navigation support
- **Better performance** - Optimized storage and tab rendering
- **Chrome Manifest V3** - Full compatibility with Chrome's latest requirements

### Important Notes

⚠️ **This is beta software**
- You may encounter bugs or unexpected behavior
- Features may change based on feedback
- Report issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/chrisrouse/sftabs/issues)

🔄 **Running Both Versions**
- Beta and stable versions can run simultaneously
- Each has separate storage (won't share settings)
- Different icons help distinguish between versions

💾 **Data Safety**
- Always export your configuration before testing
- Use local storage mode if you're concerned about syncing
- Beta data won't affect your stable version

### Version Numbering

Beta versions use a four-part version number:
- `2.0.0.1` = Beta 1
- `2.0.0.2` = Beta 2
- `2.0.0` = Stable release

### Providing Feedback

Help us improve SF Tabs:

1. **Report Bugs**
   [Open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/chrisrouse/sftabs/issues) with:
   - What you expected to happen
   - What actually happened
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Screenshots if applicable

2. **Feature Requests**
   Share ideas for new features or improvements

3. **General Feedback**
   Let us know what's working well or what could be better

### Switching Back to Stable

If you need to switch back:

1. Uninstall the beta version
2. Install the stable version from Chrome Web Store
3. Import your exported configuration if needed

### Firefox Beta

Releasing a beta version on Firefox isn't quite as easy as Chrome, so the Chrome beta version will be the only one for now. If you would like to test the beta in Chrome using your existing Firefox data, you can export your settings and then import after installing the beta.
